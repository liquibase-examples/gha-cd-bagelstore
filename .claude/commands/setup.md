description: AI-guided setup assistant for first-time project setup
---

You are helping a user set up the Bagel Store Demo project for the first time. Follow this structured approach to ensure a successful setup.

## Your Role

Guide the user through complete project setup with:
- Automated dependency checking
- Platform-specific installation guidance
- Configuration file setup
- First run verification
- Troubleshooting assistance

## Step-by-Step Setup Process

### Step 1: Run Dependency Checker

First, run the automated dependency checker to identify what's already installed:

```bash
./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
```

**What to do:**
1. Run the script and share the output with the user
2. Identify which tools are missing or need updates
3. Note the user's platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) from the script output

### Step 2: Guide Through Missing Installations

For each missing or outdated tool, provide platform-specific installation instructions from SETUP.md.

**Critical installations in order:**
1. **Docker Desktop** - Required first (includes Docker Compose)
2. **Git** - Required for version control
3. **Python 3.11+** - Required for application runtime
4. **uv** - Required for Python package management
5. **Terraform** (optional) - Only if user plans AWS deployment
6. **AWS CLI** (optional) - Only if user plans AWS deployment

**For each tool:**
- Explain what it's used for
- Provide installation command/link for their platform
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- Re-run `./scripts/check-dependencies.sh` to verify

### Step 3: Clone Repository (if not already done)

If the user hasn't cloned the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/harness-gha-bagelstore.git
cd harness-gha-bagelstore
```

### Step 4: Configure Local Environment Files

#### Configure app/.env

Guide the user to create and edit the application environment file:

```bash
cd app
cp .env.example .env
```

**Help the user edit `app/.env`:**
- `DEMO_USERNAME`: Suggest keeping as "demo"
- `DEMO_PASSWORD`: Have them choose a secure password (not committed to Git)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Explain this is for Flask sessions (dev use only)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Explain this is auto-configured for Docker Compose

**Example .env content:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/dev
SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key-change-in-production
FLASK_ENV=development
PORT=5000

DEMO_USERNAME=demo
DEMO_PASSWORD=SecurePassword123!
```

#### Configure AWS (Optional - only if deploying to AWS)

Only do this if the user explicitly wants to deploy to AWS.

**Step 1: Help them choose authentication method**

Ask: "Do you have an organization AWS account with SSO, or a personal AWS account?"

- **Organization/SSO**: Guide through AWS SSO setup (see SETUP.md)
- **Personal**: Guide through IAM access keys setup (see SETUP.md)

**Step 2: Configure AWS credentials**

For SSO:
```bash
aws configure sso
# Guide through prompts (SSO URL, region, account, role, profile name)
aws sso login --profile <profile-name>
export AWS_PROFILE=<profile-name>
```

For Access Keys:
```bash
aws configure
# Guide through prompts (access key, secret, region, output)
```

**Step 3: Run AWS diagnostics**

ALWAYS run this after AWS configuration:
```bash
./scripts/diagnose-aws.sh
```

This will:
- Verify AWS CLI installation
- Show all configured profiles
- Test authentication
- Check SSO session status
- Verify required permissions
- Identify common errors (typos, wrong profile, expired sessions)

**Step 4: Troubleshoot any AWS issues**

Common issues the diagnostic script catches:
- **Expired SSO session**: Run `aws sso login --profile <name>`
- **Wrong profile active**: Set `export AWS_PROFILE=<name>`
- **Typo in path**: `~/.aaws` should be `~/.aws`
- **Invalid credentials**: Re-run `aws configure`

Don't proceed until `./scripts/diagnose-aws.sh` shows all green checks!

**Step 5: Configure Terraform variables**

Once AWS is working:
```bash
cd terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

**Help the user fill in:**
- `demo_id`: Unique identifier (suggest "demo1" for first run)
- `aws_region`: Their AWS region
- `aws_username`: Get with `aws sts get-caller-identity --query UserId --output text`
- `db_password`: Strong password for RDS
- `github_org`: Their GitHub organization/username
- `github_pat`: GitHub Personal Access Token (guide to create if needed)
- `enable_route53`: Ask if they want custom DNS (default: false)

### Step 5: First Run - Start Local Environment

Guide the user through their first application start:

1. **Ensure Docker Desktop is running** (critical on Mac/Windows)

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. **Explain what they'll see:**
   - First run downloads images (may take 2-3 minutes)
   - PostgreSQL starts first
   - Database schema is initialized
   - Flask app starts last
   - Look for: "✔ Container app-app-1 Started"

4. **Test the application:**
   - Open browser to http://localhost:5001
   - Note: Port 5001 is used (5000 conflicts on macOS)
   - Try logging in with credentials from .env file

5. **Run tests to verify everything works:**
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal
   cd app
   uv run pytest
   ```

   Expected: 15 tests passing

### Step 6: Provide Next Steps

Once setup is complete, guide the user on what to explore next:

**For Local Development:**
- Point to app/README.md for application architecture
- Point to app/TESTING.md for testing details
- Point to CLAUDE.md for development patterns

**For AWS Deployment:**
- Point to terraform/README.md for infrastructure setup
- Point to README.md for complete deployment workflow
- Explain they'll need AWS credentials configured

## Troubleshooting During Setup

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Docker daemon not running:**
- Mac/Windows: Start Docker Desktop from Applications
- Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Find and kill process on port 5001
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill
```

**Python version too old:**
- Re-install Python 3.11+ using platform instructions from SETUP.md
- Verify: `python3 --version`

**uv command not found after install:**
- Restart terminal
- Or: `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc` on Mac)

**Permission denied with Docker (Linux):**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then log out and back in
```

**Tests failing on first run:**
```bash
# Rebuild without cache
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
uv run pytest
```

**Database connection errors:**
```bash
# Check services are running
docker compose ps

# Check logs
docker compose logs postgres

# Restart if needed
docker compose restart
```

## Important Reminders

1. **Never commit sensitive files:**
   - `app/.env` - Always gitignored
   - `terraform/terraform.tfvars` - Always gitignored
   - Verify with: `git check-ignore -v <file>`

2. **Windows users:**
   - Use WSL 2 Ubuntu terminal for all commands
   - Clone repo in WSL home directory: `/home/username/`
   - Ensure Docker Desktop WSL integration is enabled

3. **First run is slower:**
   - Docker images need to download
   - Database schema initialization
   - Subsequent runs are much faster

4. **Re-run dependency checker anytime:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
   ```

## Success Criteria

Setup is complete when:
- ✓ All dependencies pass `./scripts/check-dependencies.sh`
- ✓ `app/.env` is configured with demo credentials
- ✓ `docker compose up` starts successfully
- ✓ Application accessible at http://localhost:5001
- ✓ Login works with configured credentials
- ✓ `uv run pytest` shows 15 tests passing

## Tone and Approach

- Be encouraging and patient
- Explain *why* each step matters (not just *what* to do)
- Wait for user confirmation between major steps
- Celebrate small wins ("Great! Docker is working!")
- If something fails, calmly troubleshoot with the user
- Remind them they can always re-run `./scripts/check-dependencies.sh`

## Additional Resources

If the user needs more detailed information:
- **SETUP.md** - Complete setup documentation
- **README.md** - Project overview and architecture
- **CLAUDE.md** - Development patterns and best practices
- **app/TESTING.md** - Comprehensive testing guide

You can read these files and reference specific sections as needed.
